# noisebox

noisebox was written in [Processing](https://processing.org) a long time ago to create and layer abstract noise patterns that can be altered by pitch and tone. These patterns can be further modulated by passing them through things like synths, pedals, etc. i dont remember why certain lines were commented out and i'm leaving them in case i ever remember or figure out how to get this running on a more recent computer lol

Requires these libraries:
 * [Sonia v.2_9](http://sonia.pitaru.com)
 * [Ess r2](http://www.tree-axis.com/Ess/)
 
 ok bye.
